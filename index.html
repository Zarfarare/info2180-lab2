        These 2022 World Championships have provided exciting competitions on the track and on the field on a daily basis. But many track & field buffs have had this Day Eight circled on their calendars for a while. 
        They have waited for the women’s 400-meter hurdles final. It has been seen as a terrific rematch among the top three Tokyo Olympic medalists: The Netherlands Olympic bronze medalist Femke Bol; USA’s Olympic 
        silver medalist Dalilah Muhammad; and USA’s Olympic gold medalist and world record-holder Sydney McLaughlin. As the Eugene global gathering approached, many sensed that such a final would be a hard-fought, 
        tooth-and-nail battle for the gold medal in these World Championships. But Sydney McLaughlin saw it differently.
        <br>
        <br>
        Without any surprises, Syndey Mclaughlin won the women's 400mh hurdles finals in a new world record time of 50.6 seconds. She lead from the start and demolosh both her opponents ans her own previous world 
        record. For the year of 2022, every time Sydney Mclaughlin stood on the track she got faster and fatser. The new world is not a suprise for the persons who were following her progression but it can be argued
        that many did expect her to go that fast. I had her peaking at 50.9 seconds but she went above my expectations. Sydney Mclaughlin is seting up herself to be on the all time greats in Tracka and Field.

        Track & Field is primarily an individual sport, and often a lonely one, as those dedicated athletes work out, toil, and compete primarily on their own.
         Ah, but when global championships roll around, the relay events provide the opportunity for these nomadic warriors to bond with their track & field countrymen,
        whom they normally view as their competitors, and to collaborate with them to achieve a common goal: to compete in a first round, to make a final, to win a medal, 
        maybe even a gold medal. And the fans get caught up in this as well – doing their customary horn-blowing, flag waving, and even engaging in a rhythmic chant of their 
        country’s name – “Jamaica! Jamaica! Jamaica!
        <br>
        <br>
        In the recent concluded World Championship, the women's 4x100 relay was a show stopper event. It did not let down the crowd. Going into the championships the Jamaican
         women's team were heavy favorites to win it all. All followers of track and field knows that the race is not ran on paper. This was reflected when the United states 
         of american held off a fast finishing Shericka Jackson to win gold.
